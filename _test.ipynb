      "\n",
      "**Error 1: Authentication Failure**\n",
      "Expected Output: Error Description: Authentication failure; Possible Cause: The authentication attempt failed due to incorrect username or password; Recommended Solution: Check the username and password for correctness, ensure they are not mixed up, and try re authenticating.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Error 2: Unknown User**\n",
      "Expected Output: Error Description: User unknown; Possible Cause: The username entered is not recognized by the system; Recommended Solution: Ensure that the username is correctly entered, and if still fails, check if the username is valid.\n",

      "**Error Description:** The server reports multiple authentication failures for SSH connections.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Possible Cause:** The issue may be due to a failed or incorrect username/password combination, which could be caused by a misconfigured SSH client, a compromised account, or a brute-force attack.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Recommended Solution:** Implement rate limiting or IP blocking for repeated authentication failures. Monitor the server logs for suspicious activity and update the SSH server configuration to reject invalid login attempts.\n",

      "\n",
      "**Recommended Solution:**\n",
      "To mitigate this issue, it's recommended to:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Block the IP address**: Implement a firewall rule to block the IP address 207.243.167.114.\n",
      "2. **Enforce stronger login credentials**: Encourage the root user to change their password to a stronger, unique password.\n",
      "3. **Enable two-factor authentication**: Implement two-factor authentication (2FA) to add an extra layer of security for login attempts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, consider implementing a WAF (Web Application Firewall) or a security information and event management (SIEM) solution to monitor and detect potential security threats.\n",

      "**Error Description 2:** \"audit(1122475266.4294965305:0): initialized\"\n",
      "\n",
      "**Possible Cause:** The unofficial nature of the timestamp \"1122475266.4294965305\" suggests an error in the timestamp calculation or recording. This could indicate a bug or an issue with the system clock.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Recommended Solution:** Check the system clock and timestamps to ensure accuracy. Verify that the system clock is synchronized and that timestamps are being recorded correctly. If necessary, adjust the system clock or reconfigure timestamp recording.\n",
